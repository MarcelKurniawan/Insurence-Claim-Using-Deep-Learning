## Project Overview
The "Insurance Claim Processing Using Deep Learning (BPNN)" project is a cutting-edge application of deep learning technology to streamline and optimize the insurance claims process. Insurance companies deal with a massive volume of claims on a daily basis, making the efficient processing of these claims a critical aspect of their operations. Traditional manual claim processing methods can be time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. This project leverages the power of Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) to automate and enhance the insurance claim handling process.
